# hello-world
This is my first time using github
Hello there!

Mauricio here. So, I finally opened a github, I didn't know what was it for or how to use it. Lately I have been learning a lot and I want to learn more, so here I am. I am developing videogames (trying) in unity and I like a lot web development. I also like mathematical modelling an data science, but I haven't quite learn enough about it. I guess this is a self letter to read in some years and realize how much I will have grown as a developer.
